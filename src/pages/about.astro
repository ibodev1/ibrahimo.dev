        With my passion and dedication to the world of IT, I started to be
        interested in software from an early age. Throughout my education life,
        technology courses have been my favorite, and I have continuously
        developed with my deep interest in this field.

      <p>
        After stepping into corporate business life, I have taken great steps
        towards becoming an effective team member. I have a collaborative nature
        and adapt quickly to team dynamics. I prioritize success both in
        projects and within the team.
      </p>

      <p>
        My curiosity and excitement have always led me to discover new
        information. My desire to be innovative has fueled my passion for
        discovering new technologies and experiencing them as the first user.
      </p>

      <p>
        I respect my teammates and focus on achieving higher goals together by
        maintaining positive energy. A solution-oriented approach to problems is
        key for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        With advanced technical knowledge and strong communication skills, I am
        ready to work effectively and efficiently on every project.
      </p>

        After I started developing projects with Node Js, I developed many
        frontend and backend projects. I am doing research on how to improve
        myself every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was recently introduced to the javascript runtime Deno and was very
        interested in it. I continued to make projects with Deno and now, thanks
        to Deno, I became interested in Rust language and started to learn it.
